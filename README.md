# Hello ðŸ‘‹
 My name is Wilson, from france ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. I am passionate about Jazz, Painting, Boxing and Statistics. Here I will share with you some projects around Statistics and Data Science.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my customers Data Science project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cloud computing through AWS and GCP and DevOps best practices. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Data-AI projects that drive positive social and ecological impact.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Statistics, Data Science and Analytics.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a statistics joke, but Iâ€™m afraid it will only appeal to a small sample.
